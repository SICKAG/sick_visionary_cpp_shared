== 2.4.0

=== Changed

* *CMake*: changed logic which boost to use because of possible unexpected build errors
           when a pre-installed boost does not contain `property_tree` or `foreach`

=== Added

=== Fixed

* *CMake*: when including this module by CMake a previous find_package for Boost would prevent that the bundled Boost could be used.

* *VisionaryAutoIPScan*: constants defined by this module are now in the `VisionaryAutoIPScan` class namespace
* *VisionaryAutoIPScan*: port number of detected devices is now a `uint16_t` (was `std::string` before)
* *all*: timeout millisecond values are now a `uint32_t` (was `uint64_t` before)

=== Fixed

* *VisionaryAutoIPScan*: is available on Linux
* *tests*: unit tests `VisionaryTMiniDataTest.h` didn't build under Linux due to `Framegrabber.h` being renamed to `FrameGrabber.h`.

                             The conversion is now done by the method `connect`.
* *VisionaryDataStream* / *FrameGrabber*: port number is in host byte order here as well.
